This a small Winform C# project which I created many years ago, some of the functionalities/classes might be a little outdated now 
and they could be better replaced by new features of latest C# version, 
but during the time this project was created, the older C# version (especially Winform) had limited features. 
This project illustrates the advanced/generic approach of C# programming. 
You can also see how those generic "Converter" and "Compare" classes/components were made in details, which are currently being used in XAML/WPF/MAUI. 
You can also reuse those components easily in ASP.NET, Webform/MVC, or evens integrate with Javascript framework. (Angular, ReactJs, etc)
(Microsoft might not developed those components in the similar way, but surely in the similar direction)
